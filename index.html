              Since the 1980s, the term "poaching" has also referred to the illegal harvesting of wild plant species. In agricultural terms, the term 'poaching' is also applied to the loss of soils or grass by the damaging action of feet of livestock which can affect availability of productive land, water pollution through increased runoff and welfare issues for cattle.

              Poverty seems to be a large impetus to cause people to poach, something that affects both residents in Africa and Asia. For example, in Thailand, there are anecdotal accounts of the desire for a better life for children, which drive rural poachers to take the risk of poaching even though they dislike exploiting the wildlife.

              Another major cause of poaching is due to the cultural high demand of wildlife products, such as ivory, that are seen as symbols of status and wealth in China.

          <div class="block__article__content">
              In China, there are problems with wildlife conservation, specifically relating to tigers. However, one reason emerged as to why tigers are still highly demanded in illegal trading: culturally, they are still status symbols of wealth for the upper class, and they are still thought to have mysterious medicinal and healthcare effects.

                Elephant's tusks are used for a variety of essential purposes in an elephant's daily life. These tusks are a significant source of ivory which is used in ivory ornaments and jewelry, and estimated levels of illegal elephant killings in Central Africa have been occurring at unsustainable levels relative to natural population growth.

                The Grevy's zebra was once widespread in Kenya and Ethiopa. Today, the country is home to only a couple thousand of these animals. Hunting is the primary cause of decline of Grevy・s zebras in Ethiopia. They are primarily hunted for their striking skins but will occasionally be killed for food, and in some regions, medicinal uses continue.

                Many Asian nations have a relationship with the tiger going back hundreds, of years. However recent interest in Traditional Chinese Medicine from China and Southeast Asia has kept tiger poaching profitable in recent decades. Due to  believe the tiger has supernatural, restorative powers the animals are valued for their virtually all of their parts.

                Just 150 years ago, Africa's savannahs teemed with over a million black and white rhinos. Both species are at risk due to a huge surge in poaching to meet demand for illegal rhino horn, primarily in Asia. Poaching also escalated as demand grew for rhino horn, a prized ingredient in traditional Asian medicines - leaving both species at risk.

              Predators, herbivores and fruit-eating vertebrates cannot recover as fast as they are removed from a forest; as their populations decline, the pattern of seed predation and dispersal is altered; tree species with large seeds progressively dominate a forest, while small-seeded plant species become locally extinct.Reduction of animal populations in the wild and possible extinction.

              Outbreaks of the Ebola virus in the Congo Basin and in Gabon have been associated with the butchering of apes and consumption of their meat.The outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong is attributed to contact with and consumption of meat from masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, Chinese ferret-badgers and other small carnivores that are available in southern Chinese wildlife markets.Bushmeat hunters in Central Africa infected with the human T-lymphotropic virus were closely exposed to wild primates.
